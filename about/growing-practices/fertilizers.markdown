Growing plants takes a lot of nutrients, and Rising Sign is committed to using natural fertilizers that are friendly to the environment and to animals. This means we do NOT use: synthetic fertilizers, fertilizers made from dead animal products (fish meal, bone meal, etc.), or fertilizers extracted from mines (harvested in an unsustainable manner). We DO use cover cropping, plant-based compost, composted animal manure, and other natural fertilizers such as kelp meal.
