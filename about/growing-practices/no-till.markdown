Our commitment to building healthy soil and sequestering carbon begins with no-till farming techniques. This means we never turn over the soil using a tractor after our beds are established. Instead, we leave the roots of every crop in the ground, and add compost to the topsoil. This allows all of the carbon sequestered from the atmosphere during photosynthesis to be kept in the soil and leaves the mycorrhizal network undisturbed.
