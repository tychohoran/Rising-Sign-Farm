We know deciding to buy all of your produce months in advance is a big deal! Our goal is to make CSA shares as accessible as possible, and to put solidarity economics into practice in order to make that happen. This requires all members to deeply consider their class background and ability to pay - check out this awesome resource from Zenger Farms to help determine what makes sense for you. Please reach out to Emma if you have questions. We are more than happy to talk it through with you!

Every box will contain the same items. You decide what seasonal price works best - $450, $600, or $750 for the full season. You also have the option of paying up front, or splitting your payment into installments. If you would like to pay with EBT, or need to figure out a different payment arrangement, please email risingsignfarm@gmail.com and we will make it work. 

Every box will be filled with 7 to 10 items (approximately a $30 value). Hereâ€™s a peak at what your veggie box may include in each season. 
Early summer: rainbow chard, garlic scapes, lollipop radishes, pak choi, green butter lettuce, scallions, napa cabbage, sugar snap peas, mint, thyme, green beans, artichokes
Summer: heirloom tomatoes, snacking peppers, dino kale, purple cauliflower, golden beets, eggplant, basil, carrots, striped green zucchini, purple mizuna, garlic
Fall: honey boat delicata, sage, carrots, kohlrabi, purple daikon radishes, collard greens, fennel, escarole, broccoli, cauliflower

For the 2020 season CSA pick up will happen every Monday, from June 1st through October 12th. 

If you are out of town or need to skip a week, we will have one make up week at the end of the season. Please email risingsignfarm@gmail.com at least a week in advance of your skipped week. You can also always have a friend or neighbor pick up your weekly box in your place.

Pick up your CSA share in your neighborhood! We have pick up locations in Wallingford, Central District/Madrona, and North Beacon Hill. Please note that as a small farm with limited CSA memberships we have a minimum of 5 members per pick up location.
