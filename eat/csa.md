Rising Sign Farm’s CSA is a community-focused, farmer-driven model where everyone shares in the risk and the bounty of the farm. CSA members pay for a membership in the spring, and in return receive fresh produce throughout the entire growing season. This supports the farm by providing up-front income for seeds, compost, equipment, and other supplies needed to grow food. 

As a Rising Sign Farm CSA member, you will receive 20 weekly boxes of veggies delivered fresh from our field to your neighborhood, from June through October. In addition, we’ll send you a weekly newsletter about happenings on the farm, recipes, and other exciting events or news. We hope that you’ll enjoy some foods that you are familiar with, and learn to use some new and different seasonal produce. 

Being a CSA member means supporting a queer woman-owned business, investing in your local economy, reducing your climate impact, and embracing the seasonal bounty of the land with live on.
