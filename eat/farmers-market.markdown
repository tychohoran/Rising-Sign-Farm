Market Share

If you want to support the up-front costs of the farm but prefer the flexibility of shopping at a farmers market, you can buy a market share - it’s basically a gift card for yourself to our farmers market booth. You can buy a market share in any amount! Any market share over $200 will receive a 10% bonus for extra veggies. Once you’ve signed up, either online or at the market, we'll keep track of your share balance - all you have to do is show up and pick your veggies.
