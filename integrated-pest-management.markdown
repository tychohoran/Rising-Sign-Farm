Rising Sign does not use any chemical sprays on our plants. Instead, we work towards building a healthy, balanced ecosystem to help us manage pests. For example, we use diversification and crop rotation to reduce pest populations, interplant flowers between veggie rows to deter pests and attract beneficial insects, and use remay (a cloth cover) to protect plants from some flying insects.
