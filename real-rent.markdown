Rising Sign Farm occupies Coast Salish land, and we recognize the history of white supremacy that enables our farm to exist here. Our propagation house and markets are located on Duwamish land, and our farm field is on Snoqualmie land. 

We pay “real rent” to the Duwamish, equal to our yearly lease on the land. If you are located in the Seattle area, you can find more information about paying real rent here.
