From starting seeds to packaging produce, we are working to limit single-use plastics. For example, we use soil blocks instead of plastic trays for seeding, do not use plastic mulch in our fields, sell plant starts in recycled pots, re-use CSA boxes, and offer compostable produce bags at the market. We encourage you to bring your own produce bags when you shop, too!
