Rising Sign Farm is a queer woman owned and operated half-acre vegetable farm in Carnation, WA, on the ancestral lands of the Coast Salish people. 

We grow food that is good for people and good for the earth: our veggies and herbs are selected for flavor and grown with regenerative practices. 

Rising Sign is dedicated to food sovereignty and justice, using growing techniques based in agroecology, distribution focused on access, and growth rooted in solidarity and care.
